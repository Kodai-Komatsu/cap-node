Those events could be the reflection of important to the business and operations things that happen within the application.\n\nIn Alert Notification, events are divided in three categories:\n* Alert\n* Notification\n* Exception\n\nIn addition, severity and priority can be adjusted according to your needs. Take a look in the model tab of the post request where all possible properties for the event description are listed. Alert Notification gives you the option to extend those properties if needed by adding your own tags in the tags object at the end."
